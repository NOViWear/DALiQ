# DALiQ

**DALiQ** (Distributed Audio Layer for Inferred Qualia) is a lightweight, voice-based emotional signal engine designed for integration with agentic open-source AI systems like [goose.ai](https://goose.ai/).

DALiQ listens not to what you say ‚Äî but *how* you say it.

## üî• Mission

Decode emotional collapse before it happens.  
Open-source the emotional signal layer for agents that actually *listen*.

## üß† Core Features (Planned)

- Real-time voice prosody analysis (tone, breath, pace)
- Emotion signal classifier (no transcription required)
- Plug-and-play SDK (`daliq.js`) for Goose-compatible agents
- CLI and local-only processing mode for privacy-first builds
- Modular and lightweight ‚Äî no cloud lock-in

## ‚öôÔ∏è Roadmap

- [ ] v0.1: Modular prosody pipeline
- [ ] v0.2: Signal classifier open weights
- [ ] v0.3: SDK + Goose agent adapter
- [ ] v1.0: Public demo + CLI + full docs

## ü§ù Contribute

Contributions welcome once the base engine is live (target: Q1 2025).  
MIT license. Forks encouraged. Let's build signal infrastructure ‚Äî together.
